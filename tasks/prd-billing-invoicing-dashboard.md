This feature provides a comprehensive billing and invoicing dashboard that enables finance teams and executives to manage client billing, track payments, and analyze revenue trends. The dashboard supports multiple billing models (monthly per agent, usage-based, and contract-based), integrates with existing client relationship data, and provides full invoice generation and payment tracking capabilities.

## Goals

1. Streamline invoice generation and payment management processes
2. Provide comprehensive revenue tracking and financial analytics
3. Support multiple billing models to accommodate different client arrangements
4. Enable efficient payment status tracking and outstanding balance management
5. Integrate seamlessly with existing client relationship and agent deployment data
6. Provide actionable financial insights for business decision-making

   - Contract-based billing (custom rates per contract tier)
4. The system must integrate with existing company relationship data to determine billing arrangements
5. The system must generate invoices automatically based on:
   - Agent deployment count and duration
   - Task execution volumes (for usage-based billing)
   - Contract terms and pricing tiers
6. The system must allow manual invoice generation for custom billing scenarios
7. The system must track invoice status: Draft, Sent, Paid, Overdue

9. The system must display outstanding balances and overdue amounts by client
10. The system must show revenue trends over multiple time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly)

## Technical Considerations
