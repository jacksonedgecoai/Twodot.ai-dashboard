# Company-Agent Performance Report

## Introduction/Overview

This feature provides managers with a comprehensive report showing all companies and their agents' performance metrics. The report enables managers to monitor agent performance across different companies, helping them identify top performers, areas for improvement, and ensure consistent service quality across all client accounts.

## Goals

1. Provide managers with visibility into agent performance across all companies
2. Enable quick identification of underperforming agents or companies needing attention
3. Support data-driven decision making for agent assignments and performance management
4. Streamline the monitoring process for managers overseeing multiple company accounts

## User Stories

1. As a manager, I want to see all companies and their assigned agents in one view so that I can quickly assess overall team performance
2. As a manager, I want to view agent performance metrics for each company so that I can identify which agents are excelling or struggling with specific accounts
3. As a manager, I want to filter and search through the report so that I can quickly find specific companies or agents
4. As a manager, I want to export the report data so that I can use it for further analysis or presentations

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must display a list of all companies with their assigned agents
2. The system must show performance metrics for each agent including:
   - Successful tasks completed
   - Tasks pending
   - Performance score/rating
   - Last activity date
3. The system must allow filtering by:
   - Company name
   - Agent name
   - Performance level (high, medium, low)
   - Date range
4. The system must provide search functionality for quick lookup of specific companies or agents
5. The system must display data in a clear table format with sortable columns
6. The system must refresh data automatically every 15 minutes
7. The system must allow exporting report data to CSV format
8. The system must handle the case where companies have exactly 4 agents each
9. The system must show agent job variety/role for each company assignment

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. Individual agent detailed performance dashboards
2. Real-time notifications or alerts
3. Agent assignment or reassignment functionality
4. Historical trend analysis or charts
5. Integration with payroll or HR systems
6. Mobile-specific optimizations

## Design Considerations

- Use a responsive table layout that works well on desktop screens
- Implement clear visual indicators for performance levels (green/yellow/red status indicators)
- Group agents by company for easy scanning
- Include pagination for large datasets
- Use consistent styling with existing dashboard components

## Technical Considerations

- Should integrate with existing agent management system
- May require database queries joining company and agent performance tables
- Consider caching frequently accessed data to improve load times
- Ensure proper error handling for missing or incomplete data
- Implement proper access controls (manager-level permissions only)

## Success Metrics

1. Managers can access complete company-agent performance data within 3 seconds
2. 90% of managers find the report layout intuitive and easy to navigate
3. Reduce time spent on manual performance tracking by 50%
4. Increase manager visibility into agent performance across all accounts

## Open Questions

1. What specific performance metrics should be prioritized in the initial display?
2. Should there be role-based access controls for different types of managers?
3. What is the preferred refresh frequency for the data?
4. Are there specific performance thresholds that should trigger visual alerts?
5. Should the system support bulk actions on multiple agents from this view?
