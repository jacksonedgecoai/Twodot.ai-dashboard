### 7. UI/UX Implementation
- [ ] Design responsive table layout for desktop screens
- [ ] Implement visual performance indicators (green/yellow/red)
- [ ] Add company grouping in table display
- [ ] Create intuitive filter and search interface
- [ ] Style components to match existing dashboard theme
- [ ] Add proper loading states and empty data handling

### 8. Features
- [ ] Implement column sorting functionality

- [ ] Create multi-filter capability (company, agent, performance, date)
- [ ] Implement CSV export with proper file naming
- [ ] Add agent role/job variety display in table
- [ ] Create pagination controls with page size options

## Testing Tasks

### 9. Backend Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for repository methods
- [ ] Create integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Test performance metric calculations
- [ ] Verify filtering and search functionality
- [ ] Test CSV export generation
- [ ] Add tests for access control and permissions

### 10. Frontend Testing
- [ ] Write component unit tests for all new components
- [ ] Create integration tests for report page functionality
- [ ] Test filtering and search interactions
- [ ] Verify table sorting functionality
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for complete user workflows

## Infrastructure & DevOps

### 11. Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] Set up database indexing for performance queries
- [ ] Implement query optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Add monitoring for API response times
- [ ] Set up caching strategies for report data
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks (3-second load time goal)

### 12. Documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints in swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Create user guide for managers using the report
- [ ] Write technical documentation for maintenance
- [ ] Document performance metric calculation formulas
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Deployment Tasks

### 13. Release Preparation
- [ ] Create feature flag for gradual rollout
- [ ] Set up staging environment testing
